  "status": "LIVE",
  "text": "We shipped the inventory quality-of-life trio and closed D2–D3. 1) New player commands: /lock, /unlock, /locks, /salvage <item> [qty], /bulk_dismantle rarity=... keep=... — safe cleanup with locked items always skipped. 2) Auto-Dupe: excess copies now auto-salvage into Scrap (and sometimes Rune Dust) using per-rarity limits (common/uncommon=3, rare=2, epic/legendary=1). 3) Admin /forge_clean_user: one-time tester cleanup that keeps ≥1 per item key (and equipped), skips locked, grants Veteran Salvager badge + small shard cache, and reports materials gained. 4) Hotfix: bulk & clean now affect gear only (consumables/boxes/tokens remain untouched). Next: Day 4–5 — Upgrade/Reforge/Fuse on materials with daily limits. Happy International Dog Day to the whole pack! 🐾",

  "title": "Forge Week Day 2 — Loot Patch (Solo/Co-op/Boxes) + Lore Ch.2 + Website refresh",
  "status": "LIVE",
  "text": "Forge Week continues. 1) Swapped ALL core loot sources to the new economy: solo missions, TeamUp (co-op) stages, and boxes now grant Bones, Scrap Alloy, Rune Dust, and Selector Shards (no full gear) while ENABLE_FULL_GEAR_DROPS=false; rare boss/event drops remain a separate toggle. 2) Unified helpers and removed ‘Bones’ from materials storage to prevent desync (Bones remain from points). 3) /materials + HUD stay aligned with the new counts. Also today: Chapter 2 of the lore premiered, and we refreshed several sections of the website with cleaner layouts and a mobile-friendly pass (navigation, spacing, typography). Next: Salvage (manual/bulk/auto-dupe) and the one-time Forge Clean.",

"status": "LIVE",
"text": "Profile cards now render real badge PNGs. We filtered /setbadges to true BADGES keys, added a robust icon resolver (absolute assets/badges paths, slug + icon_file support), and sanitized markup to avoid parse errors. Result: the bottom row shows selected badges instead of placeholders (with +N overflow). Milestone: we crossed 2,200 followers on X — thank you, pack!",

  "status": "LIVE",
  "text": "Laid the economy groundwork. 1) Data migration complete: every player now has materials.scrap and materials.rune_dust plus a per-slot shards dictionary (weapon/armor/fangs/cloak/collar/helmet/ring/offhand/gloves). Pet is excluded from shards. The script created an automatic backup before saving. 2) Config set: SELECTOR_SHARD_SLOTS updated (no pet), SHARDS_REQUIRED_UNCOMMON=10, and a materials-only drop table scaffolded; ENABLE_FULL_GEAR_DROPS is prepared for the switch. 3) New /materials command is live — shows Scrap, Rune Dust, and Shards; Bones are intentionally not shown here to avoid desync (Bones remain governed by core balance). 4) Art for Scrap Alloy and Rune Dust is ready. Next: swap mission/box loot to materials+shards and ship salvage (manual, bulk, auto-dupe) with the one-time Forge Clean.",

    "status": "LIVE",
    "text": "Big systems pass today. 1) Effects are live in gameplay: dispatcher now treats effect.type='consumable' as special → all registered effects fire. New/updated handlers: xp_gain (+25%/30m), dice_luck (next roll boost), cooldown_reduction (−50%/15m), double_feed (2 uses), plushie_protect (fail shield x1), alpha_surge (+20% XP/loot/bones/30m), boost_next_mission_speed (next mission ×0.5 duration), bone_pack_lottery (10–2000 bones). 2) Items: Moonstone Orb now grants +30 pet XP once per UTC day (no level-up); Cosmic Seed intentionally unknown (for future event); Energy Drink uses the next-mission speed boost. 3) Boxes: Mystery now pulls ONLY consumables and excludes other boxes (no box-in-box); Premium rolls random gear; Legendary prefers unique pet/skin tokens, otherwise legendary+ gear (fallback to epic+); alias random_shop_reward→random_reward. 4) Feed/Dice/Missions are wired into hooks: feed uses adjust_cooldown/apply_xp_bonus/apply_bones_bonus/apply_feed_xp_bonus (Turbo Bone can bypass CD by consuming a use; Lucky Coin auto-consumes on next feed); Lucky Dice uses adjust_cooldown and apply_dice_bonus (then scales wins via apply_bones_bonus); Missions: on start, duration respects cooldown reduction and consumes the next-mission speed boost; on resolve, XP/Bones pass through effect multipliers and Plushie saves on fail; loot_table reads user_data; token drop chance kept with daily cap. 5) Inventory/UX: stricter gear detection (unknown items no longer show as gear); migration aliases added (e.g., standard_box→mystery_box, booster_xp→xp_surge, encrypted_chip→decrypt_datapad, firebone→turbo_bone, ice_crystal→icecrystal).",
