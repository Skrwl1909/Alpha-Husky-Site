Every pet now has clear STR/AGI/LUCK/VIT/DEF values instead of relying on loose defaults.\n🔺 Feral / Trickster / Mystic Archetypes: grouped every pet into one of three arena archetypes (feral, trickster, mystic), including hidden and token-only pets. Each archetype has at least one easily accessible pet, so new players can pick a style instead of being locked into one meta.\n🎮 Rock–Paper–Scissors Layer in Pet Arena: wired a light RPS system into Pet Arena — Feral beats Trickster, Trickster beats Mystic, Mystic beats Feral. The winner archetype gets a small stat boost, the weaker one a small debuff, before the normal combat simulation runs.\n⚖️ Less RNG, More Meaningful Choices: fights between similar-level pets are no longer pure coin flips. Archetype matchups matter, but RNG and progression still play a big role, keeping battles exciting instead of deterministic.\n🧱 Why It Matters: this update turns Pet Arena from a fun prototype into a more deliberate system — pet choice, progression and matchups all matter, and the backend is ready for future pet content, skills and token-linked rewards.",

XP rewards were normalized (with a soft cap for regular tasks) so progress feels steady instead of spiky.\n🧭 Lore-Driven Story Quests: expanded the STORY category with new lore quests and pet milestones (pet level 10 and 20), tying progression directly into the Alpha Husky saga instead of generic “do X times Y” objectives.\n🧩 Backend Wiring for Quests: hooked quest progress into multiple systems — missions, shop, main loop, fortress and WebApp — so actions across the game reliably emit quest events and contribute to the right tasks without hidden side paths.\n⛓️ AFK Chain Gate Lock & Claim: tightened the AFK system by adding a proper lock — when your avatar is on AFK duty at the Chain Gate, they can’t start other building runs, and rewards are now claimed manually via a dedicated resolve action instead of silently in the background.\n🔄 Unified AFK State Machine: integrated AFK state (idle → running → ready → claimed) into the WebApp + bot handlers, ensuring that timers, rewards and locks stay in sync and are easier to reason about before TGE.\n🐾 Pet Arena Evolution: refined pet XP and level-up logic so skills unlock cleanly and both daily-style progress (pet_level_up) and story milestones (pet_level_reached) are tracked consistently across feeding, arena battles and future pet content.\n🎯 Why It Matters: this update doesn’t scream with new buttons, but it hardens the spine of the game — quests, AFK and pets now behave more like a production-grade system than a prototype, which is exactly the kind of stability we need before putting a real token on top.",

Both /buy and inline buy_... buttons now share a unified check backed by per-user shop_limits, so key consumables and utility items cannot be spam-farmed in a single day.\n🧬 Referrals → Ledger Wiring: the existing invite flow now appends a referral_bonus entry to the ledger whenever a referrer is rewarded (within the 5-per-day cap), with ref metadata (type=referral, from=referrer_id, to=new_howler_id).

Root cause: UPGRADE_COST_MODEL was imported at module load (stale value cached) and a legacy `else: spend_tokens(...)` path still existed; a second handler might also have been catching `^upgrade_`.\n\nFixes applied: 1) Removed module-level import of UPGRADE_COST_MODEL; the mode is now read dynamically inside the handler. 2) Added a hard guard in the upgrade handler to enforce materials-only during Forge Week; legacy branch disabled. 3) Normalized config/env to strict 'materials'. 4) Atomic materials deduction before stat changes; int-safe helpers. 5) Anti double-tap lock around upgrade. 6) Process restart to refresh config.\n\nDiagnostics & safety: temporary breaker available in spend_tokens() to raise if materials mode is active (to reveal stray call-sites). Repo grep planned for any extra `CallbackQueryHandler(..., pattern=\"^upgrade_\")` and `spend_tokens(` references.\n\nState: materials upgrades verified in smoke tests (no 'Spent X tokens' logs), reforge/fuse limits remain green, backpack cap OK.
