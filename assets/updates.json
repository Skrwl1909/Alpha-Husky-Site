Added an event banner to the homepage with a D-3→start countdown, light glitch pulse on digits, mobile/desktop responsive picture, dismiss button (localStorage), and auto-expire after the event window. Also tightened WebApp entry points and minor UI polish (lazy videos + IntersectionObserver). Worth checking the site daily — the banner flips to LIVE coverage during the eclipse.",

  "title": "Forge Week D4–D5 — Legacy Token Upgrade Hotfix & Root Cause",
  "status": "HOTFIXED",
  "text": "Symptom: some upgrades still deducted tokens despite materials mode. Root cause: UPGRADE_COST_MODEL was imported at module load (stale value cached) and a legacy `else: spend_tokens(...)` path still existed; a second handler might also have been catching `^upgrade_`.\n\nFixes applied: 1) Removed module-level import of UPGRADE_COST_MODEL; the mode is now read dynamically inside the handler. 2) Added a hard guard in the upgrade handler to enforce materials-only during Forge Week; legacy branch disabled. 3) Normalized config/env to strict 'materials'. 4) Atomic materials deduction before stat changes; int-safe helpers. 5) Anti double-tap lock around upgrade. 6) Process restart to refresh config.\n\nDiagnostics & safety: temporary breaker available in spend_tokens() to raise if materials mode is active (to reveal stray call-sites). Repo grep planned for any extra `CallbackQueryHandler(..., pattern=\"^upgrade_\")` and `spend_tokens(` references.\n\nState: materials upgrades verified in smoke tests (no 'Spent X tokens' logs), reforge/fuse limits remain green, backpack cap OK. Monitoring continues while we clean up any legacy handlers. Next: enable telemetry (materials_spent + star5_at) and add /dev_star5 + /dev_costmodel.",

Costs tuned upward for meaningful late-game progress. 2) Reforge is live as a daily-limited reroll (Bones + Dust by rarity), preserving total potency while shifting stat lines; limit = 5/day, resets 00:00 UTC. 3) Fuse burns duplicates by slot+rarity and grants Selector Shards toward crafting higher tiers; limit = 8/day (Bones/Dust cost by tier). 4) UI parity: both equipment and inventory ‘inspect’ now show material costs and route the same Upgrade action. 5) Glue/handlers wired; legacy token text removed to avoid confusion. Note: to minimize player impact, we will run a focused test window tomorrow morning and adjust rollout if anything unexpected appears.",

No Loadout, no Stash — by design, to keep UX lean. Next: Day 4–5 — Upgrade/Reforge/Fuse on materials with daily limits.",
