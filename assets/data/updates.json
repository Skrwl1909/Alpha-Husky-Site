Next: Day 4‚Äì5 ‚Äî Upgrade/Reforge/Fuse on materials with daily limits. Happy International Dog Day to the whole pack! üêæ",

  "status": "LIVE",
  "text": "Forge Week continues. 1) Swapped ALL core loot sources to the new economy: solo missions, TeamUp (co-op) stages, and boxes now grant Bones, Scrap Alloy, Rune Dust, and Selector Shards (no full gear) while ENABLE_FULL_GEAR_DROPS=false; rare boss/event drops remain a separate toggle. 2) Unified helpers and removed ‚ÄòBones‚Äô from materials storage to prevent desync (Bones remain from points). 3) /materials + HUD stay aligned with the new counts. Also today: Chapter 2 of the lore premiered, and we refreshed several sections of the website with cleaner layouts and a mobile-friendly pass (navigation, spacing, typography). Next: Salvage (manual/bulk/auto-dupe) and the one-time Forge Clean.",

Pet is excluded from shards. The script created an automatic backup before saving. 2) Config set: SELECTOR_SHARD_SLOTS updated (no pet), SHARDS_REQUIRED_UNCOMMON=10, and a materials-only drop table scaffolded; ENABLE_FULL_GEAR_DROPS is prepared for the switch. 3) New /materials command is live ‚Äî shows Scrap, Rune Dust, and Shards; Bones are intentionally not shown here to avoid desync (Bones remain governed by core balance). 4) Art for Scrap Alloy and Rune Dust is ready. Next: swap mission/box loot to materials+shards and ship salvage (manual, bulk, auto-dupe) with the one-time Forge Clean.",

New/updated handlers: xp_gain (+25%/30m), dice_luck (next roll boost), cooldown_reduction (‚àí50%/15m), double_feed (2 uses), plushie_protect (fail shield x1), alpha_surge (+20% XP/loot/bones/30m), boost_next_mission_speed (next mission √ó0.5 duration), bone_pack_lottery (10‚Äì2000 bones). 2) Items: Moonstone Orb now grants +30 pet XP once per UTC day (no level-up); Cosmic Seed intentionally unknown (for future event); Energy Drink uses the next-mission speed boost. 3) Boxes: Mystery now pulls ONLY consumables and excludes other boxes (no box-in-box); Premium rolls random gear; Legendary prefers unique pet/skin tokens, otherwise legendary+ gear (fallback to epic+); alias random_shop_reward‚Üírandom_reward. 4) Feed/Dice/Missions are wired into hooks: feed uses adjust_cooldown/apply_xp_bonus/apply_bones_bonus/apply_feed_xp_bonus (Turbo Bone can bypass CD by consuming a use; Lucky Coin auto-consumes on next feed); Lucky Dice uses adjust_cooldown and apply_dice_bonus (then scales wins via apply_bones_bonus); Missions: on start, duration respects cooldown reduction and consumes the next-mission speed boost; on resolve, XP/Bones pass through effect multipliers and Plushie saves on fail; loot_table reads user_data; token drop chance kept with daily cap. 5) Inventory/UX: stricter gear detection (unknown items no longer show as gear); migration aliases added (e.g., standard_box‚Üímystery_box, booster_xp‚Üíxp_surge, encrypted_chip‚Üídecrypt_datapad, firebone‚Üíturbo_bone, ice_crystal‚Üíicecrystal). All changes are merged to code; only a bot restart + quick E2E tests remain (scheduled shortly to avoid launch hiccups).",
