    "status": "LIVE",
    "text": "Big systems pass today. 1) Effects are live in gameplay: dispatcher now treats effect.type='consumable' as special → all registered effects fire. New/updated handlers: xp_gain (+25%/30m), dice_luck (next roll boost), cooldown_reduction (−50%/15m), double_feed (2 uses), plushie_protect (fail shield x1), alpha_surge (+20% XP/loot/bones/30m), boost_next_mission_speed (next mission ×0.5 duration), bone_pack_lottery (10–2000 bones). 2) Items: Moonstone Orb now grants +30 pet XP once per UTC day (no level-up); Cosmic Seed intentionally unknown (for future event); Energy Drink uses the next-mission speed boost. 3) Boxes: Mystery now pulls ONLY consumables and excludes other boxes (no box-in-box); Premium rolls random gear; Legendary prefers unique pet/skin tokens, otherwise legendary+ gear (fallback to epic+); alias random_shop_reward→random_reward. 4) Feed/Dice/Missions are wired into hooks: feed uses adjust_cooldown/apply_xp_bonus/apply_bones_bonus/apply_feed_xp_bonus (Turbo Bone can bypass CD by consuming a use; Lucky Coin auto-consumes on next feed); Lucky Dice uses adjust_cooldown and apply_dice_bonus (then scales wins via apply_bones_bonus); Missions: on start, duration respects cooldown reduction and consumes the next-mission speed boost; on resolve, XP/Bones pass through effect multipliers and Plushie saves on fail; loot_table reads user_data; token drop chance kept with daily cap. 5) Inventory/UX: stricter gear detection (unknown items no longer show as gear); migration aliases added (e.g., standard_box→mystery_box, booster_xp→xp_surge, encrypted_chip→decrypt_datapad, firebone→turbo_bone, ice_crystal→icecrystal). All changes are merged to code; only a bot restart + quick E2E tests remain (scheduled shortly to avoid launch hiccups).",
